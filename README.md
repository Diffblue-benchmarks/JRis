Java RIS Format library

RIS is a standardized tag format developed by Research Information Systems, Incorporated (the format name refers to the company) to enable citation programs to exchange data. It is supported by a number of reference managers. Many digital libraries, like IEEE Xplore, Scopus, the ACM Portal, Scopemed, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink and Rayyan QCRI can export citations in this format. Major reference/citation manager applications, like Zotero, Mendeley, and EndNote can export and import citations in this format.
